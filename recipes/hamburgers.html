<ul>
    <li> <em>· Ground Chuck:</em> Ground chuck is ideal for burger patties. I recommend a lean 80/20</li>
    <li> <em> Seasoning:</em>·  I keep the seasoning simple with salt and pepper to taste. But feel free to add in garlic and onion powder, paprika, or your favorite burger seasoning blend.</li>
        <li>· <em> Cheese: </em>A slice of American or cheddar cheese is perfect for cheeseburgers, but any type works fine (try pepper jack or swiss). Or you can skip the cheese if you prefer a hamburger.</li>
            <li>·<em>  Hamburger Buns:</em> Grab your favorite buns for serving. Brioche buns are a great way to make them feel a little more gourmet, but any type is fine.</li>
                <li>·<em>  Spices and seasonings:</em> Top with your favorite ingredients! Add lettuce, tomatoes, onion, pickles, caramelized onions, and more.</li>
                    <li>· <em> Condiments: </em> Add mayo, mustard, ketchup, burger sauce, relish, or any condiments you like.</li>
